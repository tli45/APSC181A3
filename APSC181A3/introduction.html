        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          The ollie is one of the most fundamental and iconic tricks in skateboarding. Invented in the late 1970s by Alan "Ollie" Gelfand, the trick allows a skateboarder to jump into the air with the board seemingly attached to their feet—without the use of hands. The ollie revolutionized the sport, enabling a vast array of street and vert tricks that now define modern skateboarding. Whether navigating urban environments or competing in skate parks, mastering the ollie is essential for any skater looking to progress.

      <h2>Project Overview and Objectives</h2>
      <p>
        This project aims to explore and analyze the mechanics behind the ollie, focusing on its dynamic behavior and the physical principles that govern its motion. By breaking down the movement into individual phases—such as the pop, slide, and lift—we can better understand how skaters generate upward force and control during the trick. The goal is to provide a visually and technically accurate representation of the ollie through simulations, diagrams, and animations, supported by physics-based analysis.
